# Hello cheatera!
### **Some of us use checkers time to time, some of us haven't used it before, but today everything will change! Introducing Checker for php_piscine!!!**

So you can ask me: `How can we use these gorgeous unit-tests?` I can easily answer: `You just need to...`

### 1. Open unit-test folder

### 2. Watch out for an appropriate test for you

For example you need to test day01 of your piscine: `test_d01.py` fits perfectly

### 3. Then you need to configure this test for your purposes

Go to `unit-tests` folder and run the `configurator.sh` script with one argument:

Usage:

	./configurator.sh <Path_to_your_php_piscine_folder>

Example:

	./configurator.sh /Users/vbrazas/projects/archive/php_piscine/
	~OR~
	./configurator.sh ../

Now you can easely use all tests!
